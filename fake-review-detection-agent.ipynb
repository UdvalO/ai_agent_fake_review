It uses a k-Nearest Neighbors search on review embeddings stored in ChromaDB for similarity analysis and a Gemini LLM to assess linguistic patterns indicative of AI generation. The LangGraph workflow orchestrates these distinct analysis steps in a defined sequence, combining their outputs to produce a final prediction (Fake/Real) with a supporting explanation.\n\nSo, in building this fake review detector, I really leaned into a few key GenAI techniques that I learned from the course:\n- **Embeddings:** I used Gemini's text-embedding-004 model to turn the text of each review into a numerical vector, capturing its semantic meaning. This was crucial for comparing reviews.\n- **Vector Database & Search:** I stored these review embeddings in ChromaDB. This allowed me to quickly search for and find the most similar training reviews (k-Nearest Neighbors) when analyzing a new one.\n- **Structured Output (via Prompting):** For the stylistic analysis, I carefully prompted the Gemini LLM to classify the writing as 'Bot' or 'Human' and provide an explanation, specifically requesting it return the results in a consistent format (\"Classification: ...\", \"Explanation: ...\"). I then parsed this structured text in my code.\n- **Agents (with LangGraph):** Finally, I used LangGraph to tie everything together. I built an agent workflow where the state (the review and analysis results) automatically flows through distinct steps: first the k-NN check, then the LLM style analysis, and finally a node to combine these signals into the final Fake/Real prediction.\n\n📌 Check out the explanation [video](https://youtu.be/SGshgry_PQA) where I walk through the code step by step, with visuals and reasoning!🎥","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Implementation\n### 1. Set-up\n\nFirst things first, gotta get the tools ready! We need google-genai to talk to the Gemini models (for both embeddings and the text analysis), chromadb to act as our vector database for finding similar reviews, and datasets to easily load our training/testing data. Later on, you see installs specifically for langgraph which we use to structure the different steps of our detection process into a neat workflow or \"agent\". Ideally we would like to work with only google-genai, but I was running into error in the embedding section and needed to work with

I create a StateGraph, add our nodes to it, define the starting point (knn_predictor), and then specify the sequence using add_edge.

Google-genai was keep giving error when traying to use embed_content(). I also refined the k-NN prediction function (predict_review_label) to reliably switch the embedding function between 'query' and 'document' modes using a finally block, preventing potential issues later on.\n  \n- **Structuring with LangGraph:** Translating the sequential logic (run k-NN, run LLM, combine) into the LangGraph framework was the main structural task. This involved defining a clear State dictionary (ReviewAgentState) to hold and pass information between steps, and then wrapping my existing k-NN and LLM functions within specific 'node' functions designed to update this state correctly (returning dictionaries, not just values). Understanding how nodes access shared resources like embed_fn and db was also key, for this notebook, using the global scope worked best.\n\n- **Debugging Runtime Errors:** A significant runtime challenge popped up as a TypeError when preparing test data right before invoking the agent. The traceback helped pinpoint that I was incorrectly using pandas .apply() on a single row (a Series) instead of directly accessing its elements; correcting this data access method resolved the error and allowed the agent to run successfully.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Next Steps\n\nDue to time limitations and knowledge that I learned from the course, I am presenting here the initial version of my Agent. In future, I would like to keep improving the Agent with following capabilities:\n\n- Integrate:\n  - User Behavior Analysis\n  - Review Velocity/Timing\n  - Review Network Analysis\n  - Sentiment Analysis\n  - Image Analysis\n- Fine-tune smaller models\n- Add feedback loop\n- Weighted Voting: Instead of a simple majority vote, weight neighbor votes by their distance/similarity score (closer neighbors get a stronger vote).\n\nWhen cost and regular maintainance is not an issue, the Agent can compare the review with general sentiment, common themes, or even stylistic patterns observed in reviews for similar products on external platforms and make decision. It requires adding data retrieval tools and analysis nodes, then updating the workflow and combination logic to leverage this new information source.","metadata":{}}]}
